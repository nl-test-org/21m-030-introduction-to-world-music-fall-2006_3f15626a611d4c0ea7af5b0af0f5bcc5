Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Preparation and Participation
-----------------------------

Students will be expected to come to class prepared to speak aloud about the current topics, cultures, and assignments, and be ready to present reports orally to the class or lead discussions with fellow-students. The limit to the enrollment will be eighteen. A ready willingness to participate in each class discussion is an integral part of this coursework. This includes individual presentations of listening reports, comments on the reading and video assignments, and a gentle and understanding critique of your classmates' comments. You may be asked to participate in panels, presenting excerpts from the listening assignments in class. Attendance at all classroom meetings will be expected, and comprises a major factor in the course grading.

Performance Sessions
--------------------

This course includes a weekly performance session. Our performance room is a shoe-free zone, and we sit on the floor for Indian and Balinese music: wear loose clothing and clean socks!

Students are expected to submit twenty+ pages of writing in all. Assignments include essays described below and concert reports: 1-1/2 to 2-page reports on each of 4 concerts. Turn in tickets, programs, and reviews in an inclusive folder.

As do other HASS CI subjects, 21M.030 requires at least 20 pages of writing, divided into four groups, two concert reports and two project reports. The first essay will be returned to the student for revision and resubmitted. **Papers handed in after class due date will be graded down**.

Exams
-----

A midterm exam will be given. A final exam will be given in the final week of classes.

Grading
-------

The essays and concert reports will be weighted roughly evenly with the exams, and impromptu listening tests should always be anticipated.
